# Hello world for Padauk PMS132B

This project is a simple hello world application that should run on the Padauk PMS132B or 5S-I-S01 ICE.
Its only purpose is to send a PWM signal at approximately 15 KHz on pin PA3 with a varying duty cycle.

Tested with the Padauk 5S-I-S01 ICE and compiled using the Padauk IDE 0.88.
